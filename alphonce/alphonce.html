    <h1>Alphonce Ogola</h1>
    <p>I am a disciplined and dynamic team player with excellent interpersonal
      skills. I adapt well to change, embrace diversity, meet deadlines, and
      work effectively with and without supervision. I have a desire to see
      Health Systems in Kenya achieve equitability in delivery of health care
      services, and to that end I offer my contribution through
      sensitization and giving advice where and when I get the opportunity.</p>
