    <h1>Alphonce Ogola</h1>
    <p>I am a disciplined and dynamic team player with excellent interpersonal
      skills. I adapt well to change, embrace diversity, meet deadlines, and
      work effectively with and without supervision. I have a desire to see
      Health Systems in Kenya <strong>achieve equitability</strong> in the delivery of health care
      services, and to that end I offer my contribution through
      sensitization and giving advice where and when I get the opportunity.
      Currently, I am taking a class on programming at
      <a href="https://moringaschool.com/">Moringa School</a> in order
      to increase my employability and scale my online businesses.</p>
    <h2>Objectives</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>To work with people/organizations of like mind in promoting the
        health of communities.

        Kenyan Health Systems</li>
